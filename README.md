## Technologies Used:
```
  1. HTML5/CSS3/JS6: The basics of web dev.
  2. Node/Express: Using Express Generator, we got the basic express middleware routing set up for us.
  3. Postgrés: We used the Postgrés relational database for our data models.
  4. Sass: We use sass to make our css easier to style. 
  5. Héroku: The cloud hosting service, where we deployed our app.
  6. Boostrap/Materialize: Make easy mobile first design for the app.
  7. Passport/bcryptjs: For local authentcation for login.
  8. Sequelize: Object Relational Mapping (ORM) for NodeJS server.
```

## General Approach:
```
  Our idea for working on this project as a team was pretty simple: divide and conquer. Obviously, first 
  with the help of our UX/UI correspondents, we were able build a complete mockup using Skecth and Balsamiq.
  After that, we added all of our user stories and tasks, down to specifics, on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/RcBPS5kw/markit-bookmark)
  board. Then, looking at trello, we finish our individual parts in our indiviudal git branch. We often commit our works, and 
  merged, so that we don't a huge merge conflict at the end.
```

## Issues
```
  We had no major issues, but we had some issues on deployment to Héroku due to multiple migrations. But,
  we were able to fix and deploy it succesfully, thankfully!
